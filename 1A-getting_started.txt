INSTALLING GUEST ADDITIONS
1.  In the guest OS, become root, and update the system with the following commands:
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
2.  As root, enter the command "apt-get install bzip2 linux-headers-`uname -r`".  This installs the prerequisites 
needed for guest additions.
3.  Go to the VirtualBox bar. Go to Devices -> Guest Additions. This mounts the guest additions to the virtual CD drive.
4.  Mount the virtual CD drive.  As root, enter the command "mount /media/cdrom".
5.  As root, run the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run script by entering the following commands:
cd /media/cdrom
sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
6.  From the guest OS, go to Devices -> Shared Folders and select the /home/(host username)/guest directory on your
host OS.  (Please create this directory in your host OS if you have not already done so.)  Select "Make Permanent" 
option but NOT the auto-mount option.
7.  Become root in the guest OS and enter the following commands:
mkdir /mnt/host
mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host
8. Now the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS is mirrored by the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host 
OS. If you add a test file to the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host OS, it should be available in 
the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS. (You may need to reload Nautilus to see it.)
9. PLEASE NOTE: The file sharing capability is NOT automatic. Each time you boot up the guest OS, you'll have to
become root in the guest OS and enter "mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host" in order to resume sharing files between the
guest and host OS.
10. Power down VirtualBox and take a snapshot.
