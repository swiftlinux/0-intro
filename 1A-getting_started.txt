INSTALLING GUEST ADDITIONS
1.  In the guest OS, go to the VirtualBox bar. Go to Devices -> Guest Additions. This mounts the guest additions to
the virtual CD drive.
2.  From the guest OS, go to Devices -> Shared Folders and select the /home/(host username)/guest directory on your
host OS. Select "Make Permanent" option but NOT the auto-mount option.
3.  Become root in the guest OS and enter the following commands:
mkdir /mnt/host
mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host
4. Now the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS is mirrored by the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host OS. If you add a test file to the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host OS, it should be available in the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS. (You may need to reload Nautilus to see it.)
5. PLEASE NOTE: The file sharing capability is NOT automatic. Each time you boot up the guest OS, you'll have to
become root in the guest OS and enter "mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host" in order to resume sharing files between the
guest and host OS.
6. Power down VirtualBox and take a snapshot.
